- 👋 Hi, I’m @dpkode
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things, including writing readmes on GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that getting computers to do what you want is not the same as them doing what you tell them to do
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool data projects
- 📫 How to reach me -- yell "Yo @dpkode" out of your car window.
